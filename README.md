# Weather-Forcasting-Time-Series-Forcasting
Time series forecasting is the process of analyzing time series data using statistics and modeling to make predictions and inform strategic decision-making.   We are using Tensor-Flow to analyse weather periodic data  contains 14 different features such as air temperature, atmospheric pressure, and humidity. we tried 5 differet models to analyse and forcast time series data of weather.

# The weather dataset
This project uses a weather time series dataset recorded by the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry.

This dataset contains 14 different features such as air temperature, atmospheric pressure, and humidity. These were collected every 10 minutes, beginning in 2003. For efficiency, you will use only the data collected between 2009 and 2016.

### Steps Followed :
1. Data Inspect & CleanUp
2. Feature Engineering ( Remove Noise, Convert time to cyclic data)
3. Split the Data
4. Normalize The Data
5. Data Windowing
6. Create Dataset
